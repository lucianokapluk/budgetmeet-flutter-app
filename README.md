# Budgetmeet

The name of the application is Budgetmeet, The idea is to create groups of friends like WhatsApp, and within that group you can create events or meetings (for example: Asado, Friday 24), adding a shopping list, each user can take the items and buy them,and setting the price that they paid for them.
The purpose of this app is that everyone can see what has already been purchased and how much each one has to pay, the idea also that the products are saved and that the next meeting if the same is purchased already has an approximate price based on what came out last time, also the app has a chat to discuss,

It is also a good idea to organize trips.
